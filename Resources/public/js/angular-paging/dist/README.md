####Distribution Files


The distribution folder holds the source and compressed versions of the paging directive.

The distribution files are built using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) when a tagged version is released - see the `src` folder for latest

Any [bower](https://bower.io/) references should use either the source or compressed version.

Any Content Delivery Networks would reference these files.

####Using [Rawgit CDN](https://rawgit.com/)

At the moment the only CDN available is through rawgit.

It may not be the best but if you are interested in using a CDN refer to the following:

- For test/debug : https://rawgit.com/brantwills/Angular-Paging/master/dist/paging.js

- For production : https://rawgit.com/brantwills/Angular-Paging/v2.2.0/dist/paging.min.js
